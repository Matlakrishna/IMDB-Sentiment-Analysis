# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment. It leverages deep learning and NLP techniques to preprocess, analyze, and predict sentiment from text data.

Features:
LSTM-based Sentiment Classifier – Detects positive or negative reviews.
Word Embeddings – Uses pre-trained embeddings for better understanding.
Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, padding, and sequence handling.
Performance Metrics – Accuracy, precision, recall, and loss visualization.
Interactive Predictions – Input custom reviews for real-time classification.

Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK
Dataset: IMDB movie reviews dataset

Model Workflow:
